    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p id=background>I am a eighteen year old who is fresh out of highschool and decided that college would not be the most efficient path for me so I started looking at alternative routs for me to take. And epicodus seemed like it would be the best for me, for it fit my intrests and was very compact compared to a four year university. Some of the experiance that I have is working at a summer camp where I was in charge of managing some of the children there making sure they were ready for meals and other large occasions during the day, as well as leading them in camp activities.</p>
